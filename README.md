  <h3 align="center">Text Editor</h3>

  <p align="center">
I've created a backend-enabled text editor with PWA capabilities. Running npm run start initiates the backend and serves the client, while webpack efficiently bundles JavaScript files. The editor seamlessly supports next-gen JavaScript, and IndexedDB swiftly manages content storage. Users can download the web app as an icon with the Install button, and a registered service worker, powered by workbox, optimally precaches static assets upon loading. Deploying to Render is simplified with well-structured webpack build scripts, ensuring a cohesive and efficient web text editing experience.
